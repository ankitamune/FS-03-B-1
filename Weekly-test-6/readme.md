The code begins by selecting various elements from the HTML document using 
document.querySelector and document.getElementById.

An array called data is defined, containing objects with image and text properties. Each object represents an image and its text.

The createBox function is defined to create a visual box for each item in the data array. It sets the box's content as an image and text, adds a click event listener to trigger text-to-speech, and appends the box to the main element.

The voices array is initialized to store available speech synthesis voices.

The getVoices function is defined to populate the voicesSelect dropdown with available voices. It listens for the "voiceschanged" event, which is triggered when the voices are loaded, and updates the voices array accordingly.

The handleSpeech function is called when a box is clicked. It sets the text for speech synthesis, triggers speech, and adds/removes the "active" class to create an animation effect.

A message object of type SpeechSynthesisUtterance is created to hold the text for speech synthesis.

The setTextMessage function sets the text for the message object.

The speakText function triggers speech synthesis with the current message text.

The setVoice function sets the voice for speech synthesis based on the selected voice from the voicesSelect dropdown.
speechSynthesis listens for the "voiceschanged" event to populate the voice dropdown.
voicesSelect allows the user to select a voice.
readButton triggers speech synthesis with the text entered in the textarea.
The getVoices function is called to initialize the available voices when the page loads.
